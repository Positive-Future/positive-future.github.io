**Webinar broadcast on May 25th, 2021.**

While the idea of a dichotomy between, on the one hand, a wild nature without humans and, on the other, a city without nature has sometimes been conveyed, Marion Waller will speak on the basis of her work as an environmental philosopher and her experience within the City of Paris **to evoke perspectives for an urban and rural future that goes beyond this separation**. She will use the projects from the "Reinvent Paris" competition to show the possibilities that the Parisian context offers.

_By **Marion Waller**, urban planner and philosopher. She is currently Advisor to the Mayor of Paris in charge of architecture, heritage and the transformation of the urban landscape. She was previously Deputy Director of Jean-Louis Missika’s cabinet, Deputy Mayor of Paris, and oversaw the "Reinvent Paris" competition, which invited teams from around the world to rethink Parisian sites. In 2016, she published "Artefacts naturels" (Editions de l'Eclat), a book on ecological restoration and possibilities of environmental re-habitation._
