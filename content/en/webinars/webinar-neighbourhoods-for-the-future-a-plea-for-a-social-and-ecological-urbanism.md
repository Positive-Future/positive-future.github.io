**Webinar broadcast on June 14th, 2021.**

The current ecological crisis will transform the face and fate of cities, **_Neighbourhoods for the Future_ is based on the conviction that we should rethink cities from the ambit of the neighbourhood**. It revisits the neighbourhood as the designated scale and arena to build our urban futures. The neighbourhood is small enough to be tangible, yet big enough to make a difference. In order for neighbourhoods to really work, residents need to be engaged and the tactics should be embedded within a wider social policy, if we want thriving cities.

**By introducing the concepts of neighbourhood arrangements and ecologies, based on examples in Europe and North America, this book provides a new perspective on the relation between participants, resources, and rules, to spark change and prepare urbanites and policymakers for realizing their own sustainable neighbourhoods for the future.**

**_Maarten Hajer_** _is distinguished professor of Urban Futures at Utrecht University. Previously he was the Dutch Cabinet's advisor on spatial planning as Director-General of PBL – the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency. His most recent book is_ Neighbourhoods for the Future – a Plea for a Social and Ecological Urbanism_, written with Peter Pelzer, Martijn van den Hurk, Chris ten Dam and Edwin Buitelaar (Trancity/Valiz, 2020).
