**Webinar broadcast on March 3rd, 2021.**

The city is a fascinating object, from any angle: a simple human settlement; a sprawling conurbation; a teeming architectural exhibition; a place of life, work and education; a compendium of history; an ethnographic subject that is constantly being renewed?

But what is the city? What is its intimate nature? What is this concordance between it and us humans? Is it only an artefact, a simple construction? Or a reflection of ourselves, of our hopes, our fears, our ambitions; a reflection that would give it a soul? As a Great Transformation (the Green Recovery) is finally being prepared, what place will the city have in it? In what form?
