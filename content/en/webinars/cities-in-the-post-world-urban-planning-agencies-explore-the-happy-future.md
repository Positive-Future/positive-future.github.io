**Webinar broadcast on April 21st, 2021.** 

The Fédération nationale des agences d'urbanisme (Fnau) has placed its 2020 meetings under the sign of foresight. **The agencies worked in a network on the changes to 2040 to imagine a "world after" that would have succeeded in meeting the challenges of transitions.** The idea was to question the future through the notions of happiness and well-being, sustainable development and successful ecological transition, and democratic renewal, in order to build perspectives of desirable, but also credible, futures. **The proposed prospective visions have several facets: some are based on resilience in the face of the Covid-19 crisis, others are based on territorial imaginations or playful approaches to question territorial projects or the emergence of new public policies, by 2040.**

**This webinar, which will review the objective and method of the work carried out by the urban planning agencies, will present the converging trends drawn by the 12 working groups.**
