The Positive Future jury has reached the end of its deliberations!

With over 300 entries, we are proud and grateful to have been able to generate so much interest for the first edition of the competition.

The results will be announced on September 30, 2021 at 8pm Paris time, during a virtual ceremony that will be accessible to everyone on the Positive Future YouTube channel.

This ceremony will also be the occasion to unveil the theme of the 2022 contest.

We hope to see you there!
