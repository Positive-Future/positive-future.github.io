#### Presentation

The increase in computing power has, in the last decade, led to significant improvements in AI technologies, including robotics, machine vision and speech recognition. According to several prominent thinkers that have discussed the future of work and automation, there are two main scenarios for how the development of AI in the workplace will impact labor markets: (1) replacing workers with machines; and (2) using machines to improve worker productivity.

In this context, it is often argued that (1) could lead to mass unemployment and that (2) would therefore be the more desirable outcome. However, it is rarely noted that the second, “labor enabling” scenario lumps together two very different possibilities: human augmentation and human stunting.

By “human augmentation” we mean technology that improves productivity while also promoting “the goods of work”, such as the opportunity to pursue excellence, to experience community and to contribute to society. By “human stunting” we mean technology that improves productivity by reducing opportunities for the “goods of work” or increasing “the bads of work”, such as injury, reduced physical and mental health, reduction of autonomy, privacy and human dignity. We describe these possibilities in the context of contemporaneous discussions on the value of work, according to which decent working conditions are a major contributor to individual welfare and flourishing. Being clear about this distinction and what is at stake is crucial in all discussions about the future of work in the age of increasingly complex cooperation between humans and intelligent machines.

**_Karim Jebari_** _is a researcher at the Institute for Futures Studies. He defended his doctoral thesis in 2014 at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). The thesis dealt with applied ethics and in particular how we should relate to the risks and opportunities of technological innovation. Karim Jebari is interested in issues related to political philosophy, bioethics and the philosophy of science._

**_Markus Furendal_** _is a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Political Science, Stockholm University, researching issues relating to politics, philosophy and economics. He currently works in a project concerning the global governance of artificial intelligence, and how the benefits and burdens created by increasingly capable AI ought to be distributed._
