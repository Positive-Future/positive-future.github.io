  text: The writing style in "En attendant Cléo" is very fresh and very direct. We
    don’t really have a lot of information about this relationship, just that it is
    a man waiting and clearly longing to meet with this woman. But what I find really
    interesting is the fact that maybe the world, the city, the planet that the story
    is depicting, is very different from what we live today, but despite all these
    changes we care a lot about what is happening there. Even if it’s not very dramatic,
    we really identify with this man. And it shows us that somehow, no matter how
    much things can change, and everyday life can be different, there is still something
    that is going to connect us with the people who will live in this new world in
    the future.

  text: The text presents us with a future world, but it does not describe it in a
    way too heavy or too detailed. It makes us feel it, touch it, guess it through
    the actions of the characters, especially the main character. And the second quality
    is to have introduced a form of melancholy within this positive and happy future.
    To have said that even if the world changes, even if the social and political
    intentions change, even if the great climatic or other difficulties that we face
    today are overcome, human feelings will not change that much. And that the expectation
    of love, fear, a form of nostalgia or melancholy will always be there. And I think
    that's what gives this story its value, it really takes us into a future that
    we believe in, because it remains a human future, a future where not everything
    is rosy. Because we know that, whatever innovations we may introduce, the worst
    utopia would be that of obligatory happiness for all. For that would be the extinction
    of those feelings, those dreams, those fantasies, which make the value of our
    lives.

  text: En attendant Cléo" is a simple but yet very touching story. It is about a
    man who is waiting for the woman he loves. It is not a new story, we have heard
    this story before, but it makes it very eternal and universal, and that is very
    touching for everybody I guess. The story also depicts a positive future, which
    is set in Paris in 2105. And what makes it positive is that though we have seemed
    to have adapted to climate change thanks to new technologies and thanks to various
    social upheavals, and though we also have an possibility to migrate, to flee,
    to explore a new land, there is a possibility also in the story that we might
    actually like to stay. And in the end it is a story that talks about what should
    be changed in the future but also what will stay the same for us in the future
    as a humanity, as a mankind.

The short story _En attendant Cléo_ takes us to the day of May 21, 2105, in a Paris emptied of its cars, its pollution, its incessant noise. It's very hot, but it's good to live there. Vertical farms, high-altitude forests on top of buildings, artificial lakes to collect wastewater, all live with new technologies, drones and high-speed transportation. As the hours go by, we follow Auguste, we discover his daily life. Auguste is waiting for Cléo. Will she join him or will she prefer to escape to new horizons? 

_En attendant Cléo_, whose title is reminiscent of Beckett's Godot, is a universal story about love and waiting, and makes us reflect on what makes happiness... which is not always to be found elsewhere.
