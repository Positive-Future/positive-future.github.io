jury: 'Erik Overland: "When I first read the short story The Reconciliation of Knoll,
  I was reflecting, should I read it through my lense as a futurist or through my
  lense as a literature evaluator? And I chose the first, I am actually a futurist.
  What I have seen in this short story are some really interesting reflections not
  necessarily on a future debate on the role of technology in social development and
  the role of social innovations, but it’s also a kind of a critique of a “techno-optimistic”
  approach, present among a lot of people today."'

This short story explores, through the eyes of four characters, a vision of the 22nd century where societal innovation takes centre stage. While clean energy, urban farming technology and efficient public transport are important as the backdrop of the city, its most important aspects are the social institutions that have taken root. 

Based around decentralized governance and communally owned infrastructure, the city’s bottom-up institutions are oriented around empowering citizens to improve local conditions, while fostering a strong sense of interpersonal trust in the process. The resulting network of participatory grassroots allows us to envision the city as an evolving ecosystem.
