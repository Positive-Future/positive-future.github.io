  text: This was definitely one of the best stories I had to read. Because for many
    years now we have been looking for transition stories, but most of the time it’s
    kind of technocratic, showing us a world. And this story shows us first a character,
    someone we really want to know. You want to know what is going to happen to this
    woman, and to follow her. So for once the character is the main object, but at
    the same time it gives us all the landscape of transition, talking about climate
    change and all the implications it has and will have on our lives. That was interesting
    as you’re living directly in the world because you believe in the character. Then
    another thing that I really liked is that it was asking a lot of questions. Because
    in this future which is the setting the woman is in, one has the positive aspects
    but also the complex ones, like the issue of artificial intelligence, which you
    feel is a way to a better future, but which also raises a lot of interrogations
    about the way we are going to live. And in the end I loved the idea that, in addition
    to the climate issue, we have a strong focus on biodiversity, which is not so
    much addressed right now, but it’s a big issue we have to consider. So character,
    background of transition, biodiversity and complex questions, are all the elements
    that I really liked in that story. And obviously it is taking us into a really
    positive vision of the future, and I really hope that we will live in that future
    all together.

In _Papillon perdu_, we follow the day of Naomi, a scientist very committed to the harmonious cohabitation of humans and other species. A seemingly ordinary day, from the morning wake-up call to the classic scrolling of the hours of a working day where Naomi meets Jame, a mischievous collaborator who keeps her a big surprise, which will be revealed to the reader at the end of the story. 

Without going as far as pure science fiction, this short story is rich in a myriad of small details of a futuristic daily life where artificial intelligence and new technologies are present at every moment, and where progress and innovations seem to have stopped damaging the environment, making possible a return of lost biodiversity.
