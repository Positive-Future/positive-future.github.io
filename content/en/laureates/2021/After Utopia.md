  text: When I read After utopia, some things struck my mind. The first is the concept
    of “post-utopia”. The first time I read this piece, which contains a lot of fantastic
    drawings, I was a bit uncertain if I liked the term. Then I read it again, and
    I must say I really enjoyed it. Because the term “post-utopia” is a critique of
    what I assume are the kind of non-reflective or naïve utopians, who want to save
    the world and do the good things, the best things they can imagine, but the result
    isn’t always very promising. And therefore the author created the term “post utopianism”
    and I like this way of doing things. And the narrator, the subject in the story,
    the bee, is interesting. Because it is a symbol of a very interesting environmental
    challenge of our time.

  text: The first thing we noticed was the charm of the drawings, the quality of the
    colouring, which gives a very nuanced atmosphere, very contrasted, far from the
    chromos. And the second thing that struck us and seduced us was the theme. To
    approach the story from the point of view of a bee. This is a very positive sign
    in itself, because it means that in this future world, in a few decades, bees,
    of which we know how important they are and how threatened they are, are still
    there. And this bee, who has just been born and who knows that its life will be
    short, tells us in its own way the story of a world of tomorrow which is a world
    after the utopias. For a very long time, we believed that utopias were a really
    positive thing, that utopia meant dreaming of tomorrow. But what this history
    shows us is that utopia can be suffocating, overwhelming, and that perhaps the
    world we are experiencing today, and whose ravages and social, economic and ecological
    damage we are seeing, was guided by a utopia. For example, that of productivism.
    And the success of tomorrow's world is perhaps to free ourselves from this obligation
    to utopia, from this somewhat totalizing, even totalitarian obligation to utopia,
    to simply try to restore things. And this bee presents itself as a "future ancestor",
    which in itself is a very nice word

This comic depicts a future city called the Agropolis. The story follows the history of the Old Quarry farm and the lives of some of its community members, exploring how transportation, labour rights, social care, etc., work in this “post-utopian” society. 

The story is narrated by a long-horned bee who also lives at the Old Quarry. This solitary bees embody what it means to be a 'good ancestor'; its brief life is spent caring for future generations.
