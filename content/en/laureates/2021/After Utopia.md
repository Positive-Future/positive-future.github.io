  Benoït Peeters "The first thing we noticed was the charm of the drawings, the quality of the colouring, which gives a very nuanced atmosphere, very contrasted, far from the chromos. And the second thing that struck us and seduced us was the theme. To approach the story from the point of view of a bee. This is a very positive sign in itself, because it means that in this future world, in a few decades, bees, which we know how important they are and how threatened they are, are still there. And this bee, which has just been born and which knows that its life will be short, tells us in its own way the story of a world of tomorrow which is a world after the utopias. For a very long time, we believed that utopias were a really positive thing, that is to say that utopia meant dreaming of tomorrow. But what this history shows us is that utopia can be suffocating, overwhelming, and that perhaps the world we are experiencing today, and whose ravages and social, economic and ecological damage we are seeing, was guided by a utopia. For example, that of productivism. And that the success of tomorrow's world is perhaps to free ourselves from this obligation to utopia, from this somewhat totalizing, even totalitarian obligation to utopia, to simply try to restore things. And this bee presents itself as a "future ancestor", which in itself is a very nice word".

  Erik Overland: "After Reading After utopia. An Agropolis for Future Ancestors, there were some things that struck my mind. The first is the concept of “post-utopia”. The first time I read this piece, which contains a lot of fantastic drawings, I was a bit uncertain if I liked the term. Then I read it again, and I must say I really enjoyed it. Because the term “post-utopia” is a critique of what I assume are the kind of non-reflective or naïve utopians, who want to save the world and want to do the good things, the best things they can imagine, and the result of that isn’t always very promising. And therefore the author created the term “post utopianism” and I like this way of doing things. But that being said, I must look at the content and as a futurist I must say that even in a post utopian society, the After Utopia Agropolis that is described, I don’t know how far in the future these ideas are; to me the story is not surprising. But the narrator, the subject in the story, the bee, is interesting. Because it is a symbol of a very interesting environmental challenge of our time."

This comic depicts a future city called the Agropolis. The story follows the history of the Old Quarry farm and the lives of some of its community members, exploring how transportation, labour rights, social care, etc., work in this “post-utopian” society. 

The story is narrated by a long-horned bee who also lives at the Old Quarry. This solitary bees embody what it means to be a 'good ancestor'; its brief life is spent caring for future generations.
