presentation: Massimiliano Di Luca is a cognitive scientist with a multidisciplinary background spanning psychology, neuroscience and engineering. Currently holding the position of Senior Lecturer at University of Birmingham’s School of Psychology, he has previously been a research scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics working on Bayesian modelling, researcher at Oculus Research and subsequently Facebook Reality Labs where he worked on VR. He performs both fundamental and applied research to determine how humans process multisensory stimuli, with an accent on understanding the temporal, dynamic, and interactive nature of perception. The leitmotiv of his research is to create computational models that constitute quantitative and testable theories about the underlying cognitive and neural processes. At ICA4, he would like to find ways to build virtual musicians who mimic the synergistic experience of a rehearsal with multiple partners. His second proposal is to work on human-machine interaction by building model-based AI solutions that will allow both a deeper scientific understanding of the human cognitive system and a richer and more effective behavior of artificial agents.
