2100 seems a long way off!

It would be impossible to completely design a sustainable, realistic and liveable 2100 society in this competition. What we are asking of you is simpler. We are looking for stories that show that a pleasant and sustainable future is possible, in contrast to the catastrophic expectations that dominate current representations of futures.

To do this, your story will show, in the background, one or more aspects of the place of work in people's lives in the future. Work does not have to be the central topic of your story, but rather its background, the framework in which it takes place. Your story, which is centred on its characters and their actions, is an opportunity to show some aspects of this background.

You are free to define the central plot of your narrative: love, friendship, conflict, discovery, failure, success, dilemma, ambition, grief. It doesn't matter: humans will always be humans, even if the quality of life in the future society will positively influence everyone's experience, promote well-being and ease their pain. Make the story interesting for the reader/viewer.

The story will show how your characters move around, interact with each other, how they balance their professional and private, social or artistic lives, etc. This should therefore give you the opportunity to sketch out in the background what the workplaces, tools, schedules, organisational modes, the place of leisure, sociability, etc., might be like in a desirable future, while remaining realistic. It is not necessary to try to show every aspect of jobs and relationships at work, that is impossible; show some of them well, that is already good.

The Scientific Committee of Positive Future brings together various resources that gives us a realistic idea of what the future could be. The idea is to reflect on the challenges already identified, and to ground imagination on credible future development scenarios that we know or think are probable or at least technically feasible, or even that we have already seen work in real cases (for example, in the use of new technologies, the development of work via digital platforms, experiments of cooperatives, etc.).

For inspiration, please consult this [knowledge base](http://positive-future.org/resources) for a general overview of the major challenges of a desirable future. You can explore these documents in a targeted way, by key words, to see how to give substance to the life and setting of your characters.

Our jury will look at the story, the quality of the plot and the formal implementation; but also and above all at the realistic, enjoyable and sustainable nature of the background, the society in which people live and work.

By spreading positive images of the future, you will help to give everyone a motivation to change the world. Another world is possible if we all do it. On our side, we will do our best to highlight and spread these optimistic visions.

Good luck!
