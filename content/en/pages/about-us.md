title: About us

---
There are many representations of dystopian futures, depicting a frightening world and tending to discourage initiatives for change. However, there is a lot of research and foresight work sketching positive and realistic alternatives for tomorrow's world.

The Positive Future initiative was launched by the [Paris Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.paris-iea.fr/fr/) and the [Fondation 2100](https://2100.org/) in partnership with the [Institute for Futures Studies](https://www.iffs.se/en/) to make the work of foresight specialists widely known, with two objectives in mind:

* Helping to imagine a livable and desirable, yet realistic future
* Sharing positive and inspiring visions of the future
