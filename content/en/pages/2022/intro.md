Changes in the field of work have accelerated in the last few years. Technological innovations as well as evolutions in the modes of organization of work or contractual relations lead us to believe that jobs and work will be very different in the future from what we know today.

The appearance of new jobs, the possible generalization of self-employment, the new modalities of remote work, should have a considerable impact on our living environment, our housing, our modes of transportation and more globally our lifestyles.

What transformations will jobs undergo if algorithms and artificial intelligence become widespread? Can we expect that most tasks will be performed by robots in the future, leaving everyone with much more leisure time? Can we even imagine a disappearance of work? How would our lives be transformed? How would our lives be transformed? Conversely, what would be the contours of a sober, 'low-tech' society, giving a more important place to traditional activities?

Whether technological or cultural, changes in work may affect other aspects as well: equality between men and women, the integration of people with disabilities, the attractiveness of jobs or their symbolic hierarchy (the place of manual or intellectual work, for example). By 2100, these aspects could be radically different from today.

All these questions and their implications for our daily lives are conducive to stimulating the imagination, in order to depict a future in which work, a central aspect of our lives, could be for all a source of meaning and fulfillment, as well as a tool to ensure the sustainability of our societies.

The Positive Future 2021 contest will be an opportunity to propose through videos or comics a realistic and positive vision of work in 2100, by addressing its links with the different aspects of our lives, in order to both draw perspectives of desirable change and generate commitment.
