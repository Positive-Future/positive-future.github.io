author: Kite, Vance
description_en: About 10,000 years ago, hunter-gatherers, aided by rudimentary agriculture,
  moved to semi-permanent villages and never looked back. With further developments

  the Industrial Revolution, the modern city. Vance Kite plots our urban past and
  how we can expect future cities to adapt to our growing populations
