  Jean-Eric Aubert: "Vivaldi 2100 takes us through four seasons in the city of Lyon, which is very green and in which collective mutual aid has made it possible to adapt to climate change. The comic also shows the interdependence of the world's populations and how cities, taking over from the States, collaborate and share their experiences. This nice work caught our attention because it offers a realistic and credible vision of a future in which everything is not rosy, but in which the efforts and responsibility of all allow for a better life, more sober, but also more united. We particularly appreciated the fact that this work is based on foresight work and is the product of a collective effort."

  Saadi Lahlou: "Vivaldi 2100 shows an exchange between two researchers, a Chinese researcher and a researcher from Lyon. It shows in a fairly realistic and very well-documented way the way in which the major climate changes could be managed at local level, and the differences that there could be between a very technological way of life, and a way of life that is, let's say, more sustainable and based on the local economy, and above all on changes in local politics and local democracy. I thought it was very well done and quite realistic and it gave me food for thought about what it would be like to live with very low carbon emissions, that is to say, by sticking to the targets we have set ourselves. It's interesting, it's not going to be easy. It's feasible, it's nice, it's different, and it means a lot of changes in daily life, in local management and politics, compared to what we do now."

In 2100, in order to fight against the rarefaction of resources and the dramatic consequences of climate change, cities, which have become hubs of innovation, have created exchange programs compatible with the drastic limitation of international transport in order to promote the circulation of knowledge and to engage the inhabitants more deeply<!--more--> in the process of climate resilience. 

We follow Ren, a resident of Shenzen who has just arrived in Lyon, and who maintains a correspondence with Achille, a native of Lyon who has himself moved to Shenzen. 

As the story unfolds, we discover Ren's daily life and her involvement as a citizen in a Lyon whose climate is equivalent to that of Algiers today, and we learn about new city services, new societal and even ethical advances dedicated to social cohesion and the well-being of all.
