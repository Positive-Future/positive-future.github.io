The Agence nationale pour l'amélioration des conditions de travail (Anact) is a public administrative body set up in 1973 and governed by the French Labour Code. Based in Lyon, it is placed under the supervision of the Ministry of Labour and administered by the State and the social partners. Anact's mission is to improve working conditions, in particular by taking action on **work organisation** and **work relations**. Drawing on the lessons learned from the pilot projects it conducts with companies, it designs and disseminates methods and tools for employees, their representatives and management, as well as for all those involved in supporting them, with the shared aim of reconciling quality of life at work and performance over the long term.
