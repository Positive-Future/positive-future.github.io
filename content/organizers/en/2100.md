The Fondation 2100, under the aegis of the Fondation CNRS, aims to promote
the long-term foresight of human societies. It extends the work begun nearly forty
years ago under the direction of Thierry Gaudin by the Centre de Prospective et
d'Ã‰valuation of the French Ministry for Research and then by the Prospective 2100
NGO. Today, it fosters foresight efforts through a PhD thesis prize awarded with
a circle of academics, a competition on positive futures in partnership with the
Paris Institute for Advanced Study, and an international project on global foresight
(updating the 2100, Narrative of the Next Century report, published in 1990).
