Will they be high-tech megacities, or will there be a return to smaller size cities? \nWill cities look very different from an esthetic or material point of view?

      "learn_from_the_past": "Some fundamentals of human behavior do not seem to change. We have always tried to predict the future. We have also made mistakes. What have we learnt from them? Sometimes retrospection into the past gives the greatest insight for the future."
