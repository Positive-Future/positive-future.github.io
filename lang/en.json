Will they be high-tech megacities, or will there be a return to smaller size cities? \nWill cities look very different from an esthetic or material point of view? What would be an ideal city for human relationships and communities? ",
      "face_our_challenges_today": "Our society today faces many challenges, which will impact the lives of future generations. This impact, which you will show in your proposal, will be a reflection of your realistic assessment of such issues as well as our ability to cope with them. ",
      "learn_from_the_past": "Some fundamentals of human behavior do not seem to change. We have always tried to predict the future. We have also made mistakes. What have we learnt from them? Sometimes retrospection into the past gives the greatest insight for the future."
