Because for many years now we have been looking for transition stories, but most of the time it’s kind of technocratic, showing us a world. And this story shows us first a character, someone we really want to know. You want to know what is going to happen to this woman, and to follow her. So for once the character is the main object, but at the same time it gives us all the landscape of transition, talking about climate change and all the implications it has and will have on our lives. That was interesting as you’re living directly in the world because you believe in the character. Then another thing that I really liked is that it was asking a lot of questions. Because in this future which is the setting the woman is in, one has the positive aspects but also the complex ones, like the issue of artificial intelligence, which you feel is a way to a better future, but which also raises a lot of interrogations about the way we are going to live. And in the end I loved the idea that, in addition to the climate issue, we have a strong focus on biodiversity, which is not so much addressed right now, but it’s a big issue we have to consider. So character, background of transition, biodiversity and complex questions, are all the elements that I really liked in that story. And obviously it is taking us into a really positive vision of the future, and I really hope that we will live in that future all together."}],toc:[],body:{type:f,children:[{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:g},{type:b,tag:h,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:d}]},{type:a,value:i},{type:a,value:" working day where Naomi meets Jame, a mischievous collaborator who keeps her a big surprise, which will be revealed to the reader at the end of the story."}]},{type:a,value:"\n"},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Without going as far as pure science fiction, this short story is rich in a myriad of small details of a futuristic daily life where artificial intelligence and new technologies are present at every moment, and where progress and innovations seem to have stopped damaging the environment, making possible a return of lost biodiversity."}]}]},excerpt:{type:f,children:[{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:g},{type:b,tag:h,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:d}]},{type:a,value:i}]}]},dir:"\u002Flaureates\u002Fen\u002F2021",path:"\u002Flaureates\u002Fen\u002F2021\u002FPapillon-perdu",extension:".md",createdAt:j,updatedAt:j},_img:{"/_ipx/michal-mrozek-y0itdawgbxi-unsplash.jpg?w=10&q=70":"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fimage\u002F382f26.jpg","/_ipx/michal-mrozek-y0itdawgbxi-unsplash.jpg?h=500&q=70":"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fimage\u002Ff2fb44.jpg"}}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}("text","element","","Papillon perdu","p","root","In ","em",", we follow the day of Naomi, a scientist very committed to the harmonious cohabitation of humans and other species.
