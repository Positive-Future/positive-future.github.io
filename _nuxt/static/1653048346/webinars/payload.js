According to several prominent thinkers that have discussed the future of work and automation, there are two main scenarios for how the development of AI in the workplace will impact labor markets: (1) replacing workers with machines; and (2) using machines to improve worker productivity.","In this context, it is often argued that (1) could lead to mass unemployment and that (2) would therefore be the more desirable outcome. However, it is rarely noted that the second, “labor enabling” scenario lumps together two very different possibilities: human augmentation and human stunting.","By “human augmentation” we mean technology that improves productivity while also promoting “the goods of work”, such as the opportunity to pursue excellence, to experience community and to contribute to society. By “human stunting” we mean technology that improves productivity by reducing opportunities for the “goods of work” or increasing “the bads of work”, such as injury, reduced physical and mental health, reduction of autonomy, privacy and human dignity. We describe these possibilities in the context of contemporaneous discussions on the value of work, according to which decent working conditions are a major contributor to individual welfare and flourishing. Being clear about this distinction and what is at stake is crucial in all discussions about the future of work in the age of increasingly complex cooperation between humans and intelligent machines.","Karim Jebari","is a researcher at the Institute for Futures Studies. He defended his doctoral thesis in 2014 at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). The thesis dealt with applied ethics and in particular how we should relate to the risks and opportunities of technological innovation.

","The proposed prospective visions have several facets: some are based on resilience in the face of the Covid-19 crisis, others are based on territorial imaginations or playful approaches to question territorial projects or the emergence of new public policies, by 2040.","This webinar, which will review the objective and method of the work carried out by the urban planning agencies, will present the converging trends drawn by the 12 working groups.","Brigitte BARIOL-MATHAIS",", a graduate in architecture and urban planning, is the chief architect of the State and has been the general delegate of the National Federation of Urban Planning Agencies (FNAU) since 2012 ","http:\u002F\u002Fwww.fnau.org","www.fnau.org",", after having directed Epures, the urban planning agency of St-Etienne, and worked in the State services and in private practice.
