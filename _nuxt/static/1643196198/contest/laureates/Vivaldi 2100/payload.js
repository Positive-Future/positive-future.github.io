It shows in a fairly realistic and very well-documented way the way in which the major climate changes could be managed at local level, and the differences that there could be between a very technological way of life, and a way of life that is, let's say, more sustainable and based on the local economy, and above all on changes in local politics and local democracy. I thought it was very well done and quite realistic and it gave me food for thought about what it would be like to live with very low carbon emissions, that is to say, by sticking to the targets we have set ourselves. It's interesting, it's not going to be easy. It's feasible, it's nice, it's different, and it means a lot of changes in daily life, in local management and politics, compared to what we do now.\"",team:[{firstname:"Orane",lastname:"LE SAOUT"},{firstname:"Camille ",lastname:"LARMINAY"}],youtube_video_id:e,file:"\u002Flarminay-camille-comic.pdf",image:"\u002Fvivladi2100.jpg",copyright:"Camille Larminay & Orane  Le Saout",jury_notes:[{firstname:"Saadi",lastname:"Lahlou",text:"Vivaldi 2100 shows an exchange between two researchers, a Chinese researcher and a researcher from Lyon.
