We don’t really have a lot of information about this relationship, just that it is a man waiting and clearly longing to meet with this woman. But what I find really interesting is the fact that maybe the world, the city, the planet that the story is depicting, is very different from what we live today, but despite all these changes we care a lot about what is happening there. Even if it’s not very dramatic, we really identify with this man. And it shows us that somehow, no matter how much things can change, and everyday life can be different, there is still something that is going to connect us with the people who will live in this new world in the future."},{firstname:t,lastname:u,text:"The text presents us with a future world, but it does not describe it in a way too heavy or too detailed. It makes us feel it, touch it, guess it through the actions of the characters, especially the main character. And the second quality is to have introduced a form of melancholy within this positive and happy future. To have said that even if the world changes, even if the social and political intentions change, even if the great climatic or other difficulties that we face today are overcome, human feelings will not change that much. And that the expectation of love, fear, a form of nostalgia or melancholy will always be there. And I think that's what gives this story its value, it really takes us into a future that we believe in, because it remains a human future, a future where not everything is rosy. Because we know that, whatever innovations we may introduce, the worst utopia would be that of obligatory happiness for all. For that would be the extinction of those feelings, those dreams, those fantasies, which make the value of our lives."},{firstname:"Sophie",lastname:"Tran",text:"En attendant Cléo\" is a simple but yet very touching story. It is about a man who is waiting for the woman he loves. It is not a new story, we have heard this story before, but it makes it very eternal and universal, and that is very touching for everybody I guess. The story also depicts a positive future, which is set in Paris in 2105. And what makes it positive is that though we have seemed to have adapted to climate change thanks to new technologies and thanks to various social upheavals, and though we also have an possibility to migrate, to flee, to explore a new land, there is a possibility also in the story that we might actually like to stay. And in the end it is a story that talks about what should be changed in the future but also what will stay the same for us in the future as a humanity, as a mankind."}],toc:[],body:{type:e,children:[{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:v},{type:b,tag:j,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:m}]},{type:a,value:" takes us to the day of May 21, 2105, in a Paris emptied of its cars, its pollution, its incessant noise.

The first time I read this piece, which contains a lot of fantastic drawings, I was a bit uncertain if I liked the term. Then I read it again, and I must say I really enjoyed it. Because the term “post-utopia” is a critique of what I assume are the kind of non-reflective or naïve utopians, who want to save the world and do the good things, the best things they can imagine, but the result isn’t always very promising. And therefore the author created the term “post utopianism” and I like this way of doing things. And the narrator, the subject in the story, the bee, is interesting. Because it is a symbol of a very interesting environmental challenge of our time."},{firstname:t,lastname:u,text:"The first thing we noticed was the charm of the drawings, the quality of the colouring, which gives a very nuanced atmosphere, very contrasted, far from the chromos. And the second thing that struck us and seduced us was the theme. To approach the story from the point of view of a bee. This is a very positive sign in itself, because it means that in this future world, in a few decades, bees, of which we know how important they are and how threatened they are, are still there. And this bee, who has just been born and who knows that its life will be short, tells us in its own way the story of a world of tomorrow which is a world after the utopias. For a very long time, we believed that utopias were a really positive thing, that utopia meant dreaming of tomorrow. But what this history shows us is that utopia can be suffocating, overwhelming, and that perhaps the world we are experiencing today, and whose ravages and social, economic and ecological damage we are seeing, was guided by a utopia. For example, that of productivism. And the success of tomorrow's world is perhaps to free ourselves from this obligation to utopia, from this somewhat totalizing, even totalitarian obligation to utopia, to simply try to restore things.

So for once the character is the main object, but at the same time it gives us all the landscape of transition, talking about climate change and all the implications it has and will have on our lives. That was interesting as you’re living directly in the world because you believe in the character. Then another thing that I really liked is that it was asking a lot of questions. Because in this future which is the setting the woman is in, one has the positive aspects but also the complex ones, like the issue of artificial intelligence, which you feel is a way to a better future, but which also raises a lot of interrogations about the way we are going to live. And in the end I loved the idea that, in addition to the climate issue, we have a strong focus on biodiversity, which is not so much addressed right now, but it’s a big issue we have to consider.
