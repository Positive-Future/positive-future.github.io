Today, it fosters foresight efforts through a PhD thesis prize awarded with a circle of academics, a competition on positive futures in partnership with the Paris Institute for Advanced Study, and an international project on global foresight (updating the 2100, Narrative of the Next Century report, published in 1990).",title:"Fondation 2100",url:"https:\u002F\u002F2100.org"},ias:{logo:"\u002Fwho\u002Fias.webp",text:"The Paris Institute for Advanced Study is an independent research center in the humanities and social sciences aiming at fostering collective intelligence through interdisciplinary research and the experimentation of new formats of intersectoral collaborations.

Our research is guided by research programs, and the current program includes research on climate change, new technologies, prejudices that govern our actions, who will make what decisions, and the well-being of our young. The researchers at the institute mainly conduct research in this program. Our second mission is to stimulate an open and broad discussion about possibilities and threats to future social development. We do this by organizing seminars, publishing reports and communicating research via newsletters, Facebook, Twitter and our site, but also by our researchers participating in debates, visiting politicians, government agencies and companies, and sharing their knowledge through public media.",title:"Institute for Futures Studies",url:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.iffs.se\u002Fen\u002F"},toc:[],body:{type:"root",children:[]},dir:"\u002Fen\u002Fpages",path:"\u002Fen\u002Fpages\u002Forganizers",extension:".md",createdAt:a,updatedAt:a},_img:{}}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}("2022-02-01T09:48:37.442Z")));
