By “human stunting” we mean technology that improves productivity by reducing opportunities for the “goods of work” or increasing “the bads of work”, such as injury, reduced physical and mental health, reduction of autonomy, privacy and human dignity. We describe these possibilities in the context of contemporaneous discussions on the value of work, according to which decent working conditions are a major contributor to individual welfare and flourishing. Being clear about this distinction and what is at stake is crucial in all discussions about the future of work in the age of increasingly complex cooperation between humans and intelligent machines."}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,tag:o,props:{},children:[{type:a,tag:f,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:"Karim Jebari"}]}]},{type:b,value:p},{type:a,tag:f,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:"is a researcher at the Institute for Futures Studies.
