To have said that even if the world changes, even if the social and political intentions change, even if the great climatic or other difficulties that we face today are overcome, human feelings will not change that much. And that the expectation of love, fear, a form of nostalgia or melancholy will always be there. And I think that's what gives this story its value, it really takes us into a future that we believe in, because it remains a human future, a future where not everything is rosy.

The first time I read this piece, which contains a lot of fantastic drawings, I was a bit uncertain if I liked the term. Then I read it again, and I must say I really enjoyed it. Because the term “post-utopia” is a critique of what I assume are the kind of non-reflective or naïve utopians, who want to save the world and do the good things, the best things they can imagine, but the result isn’t always very promising.

And this bee, who has just been born and who knows that its life will be short, tells us in its own way the story of a world of tomorrow which is a world after the utopias. For a very long time, we believed that utopias were a really positive thing, that utopia meant dreaming of tomorrow. But what this history shows us is that utopia can be suffocating, overwhelming, and that perhaps the world we are experiencing today, and whose ravages and social, economic and ecological damage we are seeing, was guided by a utopia. For example, that of productivism.
